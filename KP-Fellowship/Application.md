# Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellow Intern Application

## Personal Statement 1
_What impact do you want to have on the world and why?_

I want to connect the world through technology and make it a happier place. Despite all of the faults of the rapid growth of technology, it allows for relationships that previously weren’t feasible to thrive. I have met so many amazing people through the internet, and I want to create new tools and experiences that bring strangers together to become friends.  Any product that I help create should incite joy to the user and leave them happier than before. It is essential to me that any project I build have a delightful User Experience, and my customer-centered approach to engineering allows me to create products that change people’s lives.

## Personal Statement 2

_Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you._

My most meaningful experience was founding a startup, Practicum with my best friends this summer. In April, my friend Jakob and I noticed that many students' internships were canceled due to COVID-19. People were stripped of an opportunity to gain the skills necessary to start their careers. I wanted to help solve this problem while also testing a hypothesis that student interns can be given a lot more responsibility than most companies think. I wanted to pair a large team of students with founders looking to grow their product and help them reach an MVP by the end of the summer.

We recruited six other friends to help get the project off the ground, and after a month of planning and recruiting, we kicked off our program with 100 interns and eight client founders. During the summer, I served as an active advisor for one of the teams while also overseeing the entire program's operations.

I learned so much about starting a venture through this process, but the real reason this experience matters to me is my impact on other people. Both the founders and students were incredibly grateful for this experience that we provided for them, and for the first time, I understood what it meant to create a product that changes people's lives.
