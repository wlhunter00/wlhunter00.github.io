    <p><em>What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</em></p>
    <p>I want to connect the world through technology and make it a happier place. Despite all of the faults of the
        rapid
        growth of technology, it allows for relationships that previously weren’t feasible to thrive. I have met so many
        amazing people through the internet, and I want to create new tools and experiences that bring strangers
        together to
        become friends. Any product that I help create should incite joy to the user and leave them happier than before.
        It
        is essential to me that any project I build have a delightful User Experience, and my customer-centered approach
        to
        engineering allows me to create products that change people’s lives.</p>

    <p><em>Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</em></p>
    <p>My most meaningful experience was founding a startup, Practicum with my best friends this summer. In April, my
        friend
        Jakob and I noticed that many students&#39; internships were canceled due to COVID-19. People were stripped of
        an
        opportunity to gain the skills necessary to start their careers. I wanted to help solve this problem while also
        testing a hypothesis that student interns can be given a lot more responsibility than most companies think. I
        wanted
        to pair a large team of students with founders looking to grow their product and help them reach an MVP by the
        end
        of the summer.</p>
    <p>We recruited six other friends to help get the project off the ground, and after a month of planning and
        recruiting,
        we kicked off our program with 100 interns and eight client founders. During the summer, I served as an active
        advisor for one of the teams while also overseeing the entire program&#39;s operations.</p>
    <p>I learned so much about starting a venture through this process, but the real reason this experience matters to
        me is
        my impact on other people. Both the founders and students were incredibly grateful for this experience that we
        provided for them, and for the first time, I understood what it meant to create a product that changes
        people&#39;s
        lives.</p>
